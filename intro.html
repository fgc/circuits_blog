    <h1>Fun with circuit simulation</h1>

    Everybody knows that Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) is a great book. It deservedly appears in many a books-that-give-you-superpowers list. 
    Among the things I like about SICP are the examples and exercises that take you on a wide tour of interesting math and engineering subjects on top of the main thrust of the text. While I can see how those would be scary to a freshman trying to pass an actual course, they are a joy to play with just for the sake of it, and if the detour is taken at heart it might still be mined for excellent PhD material.
    One example of the above is the digital circuit simulator in chapter 3. After very few lines of code and not many more of text you end up with a quite interesting digital design toy, perfect for those that like me, would like to understand hardware better but are soldering iron challenged.
    In this post and any eventual follow ups we will port the simulator to JavaScript as per Atwood's Law, play with it, and see where the whole thing takes us.
